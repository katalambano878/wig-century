## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a **large-scale, enterprise-grade e-commerce platform** tailored for a medium-sized mall operating an import business from China to Ghana. The platform will serve as both an online storefront and an in-store retail management system, capable of handling **up to 10,000 products**, sustaining **high-volume concurrent traffic**, and maintaining **real-time inventory synchronization** between the website and an integrated Point of Sale (POS) system.

We will be building upon an existing, production-ready e-commerce platform that already includes a robust feature set — including a full storefront, admin dashboard, POS system, payment processing, notification systems, and PWA capabilities. This significantly reduces development time, risk, and cost compared to building from scratch, while ensuring a battle-tested foundation.

### Key Highlights

- **10,000+ Product Capacity** with advanced catalog management
- **Real-Time POS Synchronization** — stock levels, prices, and orders always in sync
- **Google Maps API Integration** for delivery zone mapping and distance-based pricing
- **Enterprise-Grade Performance** — designed to handle traffic spikes and high concurrency
- **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard** — full control over every aspect of the business
- **Multi-Role Access Control** — Admin, Manager, Sales Rep, Warehouse Staff, and more
- **Mobile Money & Card Payments** — integrated for the Ghanaian market
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — app-like experience on any device
- **SMS & Email Notifications** — automated customer communication
- **Analytics & Reporting** — data-driven business insights

## 5. POS System & Real-Time Synchronization

This is a critical component of the project. The POS system must function as a seamless extension of the e-commerce platform, ensuring that **every sale — whether online or in-store — is instantly reflected across both systems.**

### 5.1 Architecture Approach

We propose a **unified database architecture** where both the website and the POS system share the same Supabase (PostgreSQL) database. This eliminates synchronization delays and ensures absolute consistency.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SUPABASE DATABASE                     │
│              (Single Source of Truth)                    │
│                                                         │
│  ┌─────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌──────────┐  │
│  │Products │  │Inventory │  │ Orders  │  │Customers │  │
│  └─────────┘  └──────────┘  └─────────┘  └──────────┘  │
└──────────┬──────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
           │                      │
    ┌──────┴──────┐        ┌──────┴──────┐
    │             │        │             │
    │  WEBSITE    │        │  POS SYSTEM │
    │  (Online    │        │  (In-Store  │
    │  Customers) │        │  Sales Reps)│
    │             │        │             │
    └─────────────┘        └─────────────┘
```

#### How It Works:

1. **Single Database** — Both systems read and write to the same database tables.
2. **Real-Time Subscriptions** — Supabase Realtime channels push instant updates to all connected clients. When a POS sale reduces stock, the website reflects it immediately, and vice versa.
3. **Atomic Transactions** — Stock reductions happen within database transactions to prevent race conditions and overselling.
4. **Optimistic Locking** — When two sales reps or a customer and a sales rep try to sell the last unit simultaneously, the system uses row-level locking to ensure only one succeeds.
